ISS 25th Anniversary Apps: A Triple-Gateway to Space Exploration
​Project for the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025
Team: Bots Tech
​1. Project Summary
​This project is a comprehensive web platform designed to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the International Space Station (ISS). Our solution addresses the "International Space Station 25th Anniversary Apps" challenge by creating a multifaceted experience that aims to inspire, educate, and engage a global audience with space science.
​Our platform is built on three core pillars, creating a complete "engagement funnel":
​A Commemorative Games Portal (portal-de-jogos-iss.html): To spark initial interest and provide a fun, interactive entry point into the world of space exploration.
​An Informative & Professional Website (index.html): To provide historical context, explain the scientific importance of the ISS, and outline our mission.
​A Live ISS Data Dashboard (iss-dados.html): To empower users with real-time NASA data, transforming the abstract concept of the ISS into a tangible, explorable reality.
​2. Our Mission (The "Problem" We Solve & Our Impact)
​The Problem: For many people, space exploration feels distant, overly complex, and inaccessible. This creates a disconnect between the public and one of humanity's greatest scientific achievements.
​Our Solution & Impact: Our project directly tackles this challenge of disconnection. We don't just present information; we create an experience.
​We Inspire: Through gamification, we capture the imagination of a younger, broader audience.
​We Educate: Our main site and interactive timeline make the history and science of the ISS easy to understand.
​We Engage: The live data dashboard allows anyone to become a real-time observer of the ISS, fostering a direct connection to NASA's ongoing mission.
​Our impact is measured by our ability to spark curiosity and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and explorers, making space science accessible to all.
​3. How We Use NASA Data
​This project is fundamentally powered by NASA's open data, which we have integrated in multiple ways to ensure authenticity and scientific validation.
​Real-Time ISS Location: We use live telemetry data to plot the exact position of the ISS on a world map. The data is refreshed every 5 seconds.
​Live Flight Data: We display the ISS's current altitude, velocity, latitude, and longitude.
​Current Crew Information: We use a public API to list the names of the astronauts currently living and working aboard the station.
​Visible Pass Times: Our dashboard can use a person's geolocation to calculate and display the next opportunities to see the ISS pass overhead in their own sky, a key feature for public engagement.
​4. Addressing the Judging Criteria
​Impact: Our project has a significant educational and inspirational impact, making space science accessible and exciting for a global audience of all ages.
​Creativity: Our unique three-pillar structure (Games, Information, Live Data) is a creative and highly effective approach to scientific communication, catering to different levels of user interest.
​Validation: Our solution is 100% functional. The successful integration of multiple live APIs validates its technical feasibility and provides a real, not simulated, experience.
​Relevance: Our project is a direct and comprehensive response to the challenge. We celebrate the ISS's past (history), present (live data), and future (by inspiring the next generation).
​Presentation: Our project is presented through clean, intuitive, and fully bilingual (EN/PT) web interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience.
